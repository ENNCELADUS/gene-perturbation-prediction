  abstract = {Cellular responses to perturbations are a cornerstone for understanding biological mechanisms and selecting drug targets. While machine learning models offer tremendous potential for predicting perturbation effects, they currently struggle to generalize to unobserved cellular contexts. Here, we introduce State, a transformer model that predicts perturbation effects while accounting for cellular heterogeneity within and across experiments. State predicts perturbation effects across sets of cells and is trained using gene expression data from over 100 million perturbed cells. State improved discrimination of effects on large datasets by more than 30\% and identified differentially expressed genes across genetic, signaling and chemical perturbations with significantly improved accuracy. Using its cell embedding trained on observational data from 167 million cells, State identified strong perturbations in novel cellular contexts where no perturbations were observed during training. We further introduce Cell-Eval, a comprehensive evaluation framework that highlights State’s ability to detect cell type-specific perturbation responses, such as cell survival. Overall, the performance and flexibility of State sets the stage for scaling the development of virtual cell models.},

  abstract   = {The cell is arguably the most fundamental unit of life and is central to understanding biology. Accurate modeling of cells is important for this understanding as well as for determining the root causes of disease. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), combined with the ability to generate large-scale experimental data, present novel opportunities to model cells. Here we propose a vision of leveraging advances in AI to construct virtual cells, high-fidelity simulations of cells and cellular systems under different conditions that are directly learned from biological data across measurements and scales. We discuss desired capabilities of such AI Virtual Cells, including generating universal representations of biological entities across scales, and facilitating interpretable in silico experiments to predict and understand their behavior using Virtual Instruments. We further address the challenges, opportunities and requirements to realize this vision including data needs, evaluation strategies, and community standards and engagement to ensure biological accuracy and broad utility. We envision a future where AI Virtual Cells help identify new drug targets, predict cellular responses to perturbations, as well as scale hypothesis exploration. With open science collaborations across the biomedical ecosystem that includes academia, philanthropy, and the biopharma and AI industries, a comprehensive predictive understanding of cell mechanisms and interactions has come into reach.},

               Predicting single-cell transcriptional responses to perturbations is central to dissecting gene regulation and accelerating therapeutic design, yet the field lacks a rigorous, task-spanning assessment of model behavior. We present a large-scale benchmark of 12 representative methods and 3 baselines across 25 datasets spanning diverse perturbation modalities and species, including two new primary immune-cell drug-response resources. We evaluated three core tasks—generalization to unseen single-gene perturbations, prediction of combinatorial interactions, and transfer across cell types—using 24 metrics covering expression-level accuracy, relative changes, differential expression recovery, and distributional similarity. Across tasks, performance depended strongly on perturbation effect size and evaluation perspective: expression-level agreement was highest for small-effect perturbations resembling controls, whereas delta- and DE-based metrics improved with larger effects, providing clearer signals. Models shared a conservative bias, with fine-tuned foundation models compressing variance and underestimating synergistic effects in combinations. PerturbNet showed superior recovery of DE signatures in Tasks 1 and 2, while no method consistently generalized across cell types in Task 3, where dataset heterogeneity dominated outcomes. This benchmark establishes current methodological limits, clarifies when metrics diverge, and provides a foundation for developing virtual-cell models that more faithfully capture heterogeneous perturbation responses.},

              Understanding cellular responses to genetic perturbation is central to numerous biomedical applications, from identifying genetic interactions involved in cancer to developing methods for regenerative medicine. However, the combinatorial explosion in the number of possible multigene perturbations severely limits experimental interrogation. Here, we present graph-enhanced gene activation and repression simulator (GEARS), a method that integrates deep learning with a knowledge graph of gene–gene relationships to predict transcriptional responses to both single and multigene perturbations using single-cell RNA-sequencing data from perturbational screens. GEARS is able to predict outcomes of perturbing combinations consisting of genes that were never experimentally perturbed. GEARS exhibited 40\% higher precision than existing approaches in predicting four distinct genetic interaction subtypes in a combinatorial perturbation screen and identified the strongest interactions twice as well as prior approaches. Overall, GEARS can predict phenotypically distinct effects of multigene perturbations and thus guide the design of perturbational experiments.},
